        found : 03 12 2019 
        solution : the modification is added at the end of the doc to ensire it'll be taken in account, if there's a selection then the modficiation occurs within the selection

- create default script loaded at startup and editable from internal IDE
- drag and drop to import new ressources
- when creating data and loading if project name is a symbol it crash
- save datas (Mobile)
- Bad resize on mobile when opening keyboard
- ide resize is bad (especially on device chage orientation and remove safari debug window) :  bad bottom calculation of different elements
- console invisible at startup until using dragbar
- Widh height ratio can't be change
- properties not assigned when creating an objet using Atome class instead of simplified creation methods
- when getting object infos the id is lost
- id not in atome hash
- id not set at startup
- multiple sleep
- python compiler
- add run at startup in code
- add open_ide at startup in code
- add open_console at startup in code 
- opening codemirror conent is blank until clicked
- verified method chaining
- alter base ruby class with Opal  (String, Int)
- console in canvas with text selection
- when passing multiple items in hash a objet creation time only first item is compute other are ignored
- canvas not responsive anymore: it doesn't resize when resizing main window (occurs when change zim canvas ID)
- add correlation table between id and atome_id
- objects events handling
- add grab method to ruby's APIs
- get id from ruby
- reset Atome.atomes.length at each run of the script corected in : abstraction_lib  / run_code() / Atome.new.nuke
- create getter
- object ID :user_machine_location_date_nb
- sleep function for JS
- clear view
- ide is empty at launch (no line numbering or else)
- at first launch there's no file created so file reader launch an exeption
- Si ide ouvert au demarrage on perd la sauvegarde
- Si une seule ligne dans l'ide le contenu n'est pas sauvegard√©
- better code loading and saving with promises instead of setTimeOut
- ZimJs change canvas ID
- automatisation of new methods creation in both JS and ruby
- add methods to objects (color, x, width, ...)
- create default params send at object construction time
- get objet by ID
- add iD to object
- load code
- save code
- copy text from console
- change Ruby base class
- comment code
- sleep
- Autorun
- debugger (try and catch)
- Allow select all in ide(iOS)
- View cursor in ide (iOS)
- On mousedown drags are accumulated
- replace line or content in line in IDE
- Save load projects
- Set base canvas ID
-  Allow spacebar in ide 
      solution 1 : zim can be handled in a few ways.  Its purpose is to stop the ZIM canvas from being moved by    arrows, spacebar, scrollwheel, etc.  But you can override it with allowDefault in the Frame call - so check that out in the docs.  It also says how you can individually choose things in the zil docs
      soloution 2 : just comment this line in Zim.Js at function zil() comment : // (e = e || event).keyCode && 32 <= e.keyCode && e.keyCode <= 40 && e.preventDefault()
