Problem ios :

 - doc.find is not a function : delete ios.json in platform/ios/
check the iOS specific options in main config.xml in   <platform name="ios"> three is a bad option 
The error has thrown when the platforms/ios/ios.json file is conflicting to the config.xml.
To resolve this issue, remove *-Info.plist key and its value in platforms/ios/ios.json and do cordova prepare ios

- Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code : recreate copy-www-build-step.sh  in atome/platforms/ios/atome/Scripts folder or simply re-save it with textmate or other text editor

- can't compile :  sign the app in signing& capabilities

(attention this method is overwrite at each new deployment)This requires you to modify your app's info.plist file inside platforms/ios/atome/atome-Info.plist file to add the following lines: at the end of file before the </dict> closing tag
<key>UIStatusBarHidden</key>
<true/>
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>


- to allow itunes file sharing
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-itunesfilesharing
